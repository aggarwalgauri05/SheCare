      <h2>What is the birth control patch?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The transdermal contraceptive patch is a safe and convenient birth control method that works really well if you always use it correctly. You wear the patch on certain parts of your body, and it releases hormones through your skin that prevent pregnancy. The patch has lots of other health benefits, too.<br><br>

        There are two brands of birth control patches available : the Xulane patch and the Twirla patch.<br><br>

      <h2>How effective is the birth control patch?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>If you use it perfectly, the patch is 99% effective. But people aren’t perfect, and it can be easy to make a mistake — so in reality, the patch is about 93% effective. That means about 7 out of 100 patch users get pregnant each year.<br><br>

        The better you are about using your patch correctly, the better it will work. Your chances of getting pregnant on the patch depend on how well you follow the directions for using it. But there’s a very small chance that you could still get pregnant, even if you always use the patch perfectly.<br><br>
        
        Make sure you always stay on schedule with your patches. Only put the patch on clean, dry skin. And check your patch every day to make sure the edges are sticking to your skin. <br><br>
        
        If the patch gets loose, you can put it back on as long as it’s sticky enough to stay all the way on your skin — if the patch won’t stick anymore, throw it away and put on a new patch.<br><br>
        
        Don’t try to put a patch back on if:<br><br>
        
        1.It isn’t sticky enough to stay all the way on.<br><br>
        2.It gets stuck to itself or something else.<br><br>
        3.It fell all the way off your skin.<br><br>
       4.Don’t use tape or other materials to stick a non-sticky patch back on your skin. If a patch doesn’t stick to your skin by itself, it won’t work — put on a new patch right away.<br><br>
        
        If it’s been more than 1 day (for Twirla), or 2 days (for Xulane) since your patch came loose, put on a new patch right away.<br><br> </p>

      <h2>What side effects should I expect from the birth control patch?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The hormones in the birth control patch may cause side effects in some people. But this doesn’t happen to everyone — many people use the patch with no problems. <br><br>

        After starting the patch, some people may have: <br><br>
        
        1.Headaches <br><br>
        
        2.Nausea<br><br>
        
        3.Sore breasts<br><br>
        
        4.Changes in your periods (early, late, or stopping altogether while on the patch)<br><br>
        
        5.Spotting (light bleeding or brown discharge)<br><br>
        
        6.Skin reactions where the patch goes (like itching, dryness, pain, swelling, or a rash)<br><br>
        
        The good news is that these side effects usually go away in 2-3 months. So if you just started using the patch and you have side effects that bother you, try to stick it out and give your body a chance to adjust to the hormones.<br><br> </p>
