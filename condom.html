      <h2>What is a condom?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Condoms are small, thin pouches that cover your penis during sex and collect semen (cum). Condoms prevent pregnancy by stopping sperm from getting into the vagina, so sperm can’t meet up with an egg. Some types of condoms also help prevent STDs.<br><br>

        There are 3 types of condoms: latex condoms, plastic (non latex) condoms, and lambskin (animal skin) condoms.<br><br></p>

      <h2>How effective are condoms against pregnancy?
    </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>If you use condoms perfectly every single time you have sex, they’re 98% effective at preventing pregnancy. But people aren’t perfect, so in real life condoms are about 87% effective — that means about 13 out of 100 people who use condoms as their only birth control method will get pregnant each year.<br><br>

        The better you are about using condoms correctly every time you have sex, the better they’ll work. But there’s a small chance that you will get pregnant even if you always use them the right way.</p><br><br>

      <h2>How can I make condoms more effective?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>he best way to make condoms work as well as possible is to use them correctly every single time you have vaginal, oral, and anal sex. That means wearing it the whole time, from start to finish. Make sure the condom is rolled on your penis the right way before there’s any skin-to-skin genital contact. Read more about how to use condoms correctly.<br><br>

        Using condoms + another form of birth control (like the pill, IUD, or shot) is a great way to get extra pregnancy prevention AND protection against STDs. Using withdrawal (“pulling out”) while also wearing a condom can help keep sperm out of the vagina and lower the risk for pregnancy.<br><br>
        
        You shouldn’t wear two condoms at the same time, or use a condom worn on the penis together with an internal condom. Condoms are designed to be used on their own, and doubling up may increase the chances of tearing. So your best bet is to only use one condom at a time — as long as you're using it correctly, one condom is all the protection you need. Also make sure your condoms aren't expired by checking the date on the wrapper or box.<br><br></p>
