      <p>The birth control implant (AKA Nexplanon) is a tiny, thin rod about the size of a matchstick. The implant releases hormones into your body that prevent you from getting pregnant. A nurse or doctor inserts the implant into your arm and that’s it — you’re protected from pregnancy for up to 5 years. It’s get-it-and-forget-it birth control.</p>

        <h2>How does the implant work?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The birth control implant is a tiny, thin rod about the size of a matchstick. It’s also called Nexplanon and there’s a slightly older version called Implanon. A doctor inserts the implant under the skin of your upper arm. It releases the hormone progestin to stop you from getting pregnant.<br><br>

            <b>The hormones in the birth control implant prevent pregnancy in two ways:</b><br><br>
            
            1. Progestin thickens the mucus on your cervix, which stops sperm from swimming through to your egg. When sperm can’t meet up with an egg, pregnancy can’t happen.<br><br>
            
            2. Progestin can also stop eggs from leaving your ovaries (called ovulation), so there’s no egg to fertilize. When eggs aren’t released, you can’t get pregnant.<br><br>
            
            One of the awesome things about the implant is that it lasts for a long time — up to 5 years — but it’s not permanent. If you decide you want to get pregnant or you just don’t want to have your implant anymore, your doctor can take it out. You’re able to get pregnant quickly after the implant is removed. You can keep track of your insertion and removal dates using our birth control app. </p>

      <h2>How effective is the implant?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The implant is one of the best birth control methods out there — it’s more than 99% effective. That means fewer than 1 out of 100 people who use Nexplanon will get pregnant each year. It doesn’t get much better than that.<br><br>

        The implant is so effective because there's no chance of making a mistake. Since it’s in your arm, you can’t forget to take it, or use it incorrectly. It protects you from pregnancy all day, every day for up to 5 years. If you decide you want to get pregnant, a nurse or doctor can take it out and you can get pregnant right away.<br><br>
        
        The implant doesn’t protect you from STDs, so use condoms along with the implant to help protect you from both pregnancy and STDs. That’s how you make sex worry-free.</p><br>

      <h2>What are the disadvantages of birth control implants?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Some people get side effects that bother them after getting their implant, but these usually go away after a few months. Rarely, the side effects can be serious.<br><br>
        The most common side effect is irregular bleeding (aka spotting), especially in the first 6-12 months. But most people on the implant get lighter periods, or their periods stop altogether while they have the implant. Other possible side effects that aren’t as common include headaches, breast pain, and nausea. There may also be temporary pain, bruising, or an infection on your arm where you got the implant.<br><br>

Birth control shouldn’t make you feel bad. Luckily, there are many different types of birth control, so you’ve got options. If you keep having side effects that bother you, talk with your nurse or doctor about trying another birth control method.<br><br>
Birth control implants are one of the best methods of birth control out there, but they don’t protect you from sexually transmitted infections.<br><br>
