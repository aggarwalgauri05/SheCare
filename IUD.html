      <h2>What’s an IUD?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>An IUD is a tiny device that's put into your uterus to prevent pregnancy. It’s long-term, reversible, and one of the most effective birth control methods out there.<br><br>
        IUD stands for Intrauterine Device (basically: a device inside your uterus). It's a small piece of flexible plastic shaped like a T. Sometimes it’s called an IUC — intrauterine contraception.<br><br>
        <b> IUDs are divided into 2 types:</b><br><br>

1.hormonal IUDs (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla).<br><br>
2.copper IUDs (Paragard) and<br><br>
The Paragard IUD doesn’t have hormones. It’s wrapped in a tiny bit of copper, and it protects you from pregnancy for up to 12 years.<br><br>

The Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla IUDs use the hormone progestin to prevent pregnancy. Progestin is very similar to the hormone progesterone that our bodies make naturally. Mirena works for up to 8 years. Kyleena works for up to 5 years. Liletta works for up to 8 years. Skyla works for up to 3 years.<br><br>

      <h2>How effective are IUDs when used as birth control?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>IUDs are one of the best birth control methods out there — more than 99% effective. That means fewer than 1 out of 100 people who use an IUD will get pregnant each year.<br><br>

        IUDs are so effective because there's no chance of making a mistake. You can’t forget to take it (like the pill), or use it incorrectly (like condoms). And you're protected from pregnancy 24/7 for 3 to 12 years, depending on which kind you get. Once your IUD is in place, you can pretty much forget about it until it expires.<br><br></p>

      <h2>Can I get an IUD?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Most people can use IUDs safely, but there are some conditions that make side effects or complications more likely. Talk to your nurse or doctor to find out if IUDs are safe for you.<br><br>

        You may not be able to get an IUD if you<br><br>
        
        1.have certain STDs or pelvic infection<br><br>
        
        2.think you might be pregnant<br><br>
        
        3.have cervical cancer that hasn't been treated<br><br>
        
        4.have cancer of the uterus<br><br>
        
        5have had a pelvic infection after either childbirth or an abortion in the past 3 months<br><br>
        
        You also shouldn't get a Paragard IUD if you have a copper allergy, Wilson's Disease, or a bleeding disorder that makes it hard for your blood to clot. If you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), you’re at higher risk for extra heavy bleeding on Paragard.<br><br>
        
        Don’t get a hormonal IUD if you’ve had breast cancer. If you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and you have antiphospholipid antibodies (or if you don’t know), you’re at higher risk for serious blood clots while using a hormonal IUD.<br><br>
        
        Very rarely, the size or shape of someone’s uterus makes it hard to place an IUD correctly.</p>
